# Acoustic Modeling
This is a project designed to help model and vizualize acoustic systems.
This is made to help with calculating the RT60 value, which is useful for seeing how well a particular room impacts voice intelligibilty.

## Usage Instructions

- Use the "Select file" dialog to select a file
- Click the start modeling button
- A window should pop up, telling you a bunch of information about the model generated from the file.
- Use the three buttons at the bottom to show some plots which vizualize the model
- In the RT60 plot, use the second set of left and right arrows at the bottom to switch between low frequency, medium frequency, high frequency, or all three graphs combined
- Close the Model Information window if you want to model a new file
